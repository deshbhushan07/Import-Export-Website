# AC Global Trade — Import & Export Website

**Why this repository exists**

This repository contains a responsive static website for an import–export business. I built it to:
- Create an online presence to present company information and product catalogs.
- Practice and demonstrate frontend development skills (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, Bootstrap).
- Keep product data and site content versioned in GitHub and deploy via GitHub Pages.

## What’s inside
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `contact.html`
- `products/` — product listing and product detail template
- `assets/` — CSS, JS, images
- `data/products.json` — product data used by the site

## How to run locally
1. Clone the repo.
2. Serve the folder with a static server (recommended). Example:
   ```bash
   # using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   # open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
